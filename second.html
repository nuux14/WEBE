  <h1>Headings for Titles </h1>
  <p>
    The rest of the text is usually put in paragraph.
    What happens is that if you insert more spaces
    between          words, html will remove extra spaces
    except one. Similarly if you
    break 
    lines
    HTML is designed
    to remove them.
  </p>
  <p> So to over this scenario we use the pre tag which stands
      for preformatted text. This preserves extra 
      <pre> spaces       we        use and
       line
       breaks 
       we insert into
       document
       </pre>
    In the old html there used to be elements for 
    <b>presentation</b> and that don't have additional
    <i>purpose</i>. These elements are replaced by the
     <em>emphasize</em> and <strong>strong</strong> elements
    which have semantic meaning useful for machines

   <p> <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
      is a markup language used to publish documents on
      the internet. Sometimes we need to <blockquote>
      make some of the text standout of the rest</blockquote>
      and if we need to use <q>double quotation</q> we 
      have the q element.
   </p>
   <p>According to Wikipedia <cite>HTML is the standard
      language for publishing contents on a network</cite>
    To tell the machine there is a code part in our text
    we use the code element: <code> for(int i=0;;){//}</code>
    On the otherside if we have a formula and we would
    like to tell the machine about it <var>c=d+c<sup>2</sup> </var>
    Water formula <var> H<sub>2</sub>O</var>
